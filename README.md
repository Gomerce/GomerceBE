## Datebase setup

### Create databases

Create a Postgres database with the name matching what you have on the `.env` file for `DB_NAME` and `TEST_DB_NAME`. For example:

createdb gomerce-test
```

### Export your flask app

In order to run your migrations and app using the `flask` command, expose your flask app:

- for Linux / macOS

export FLASK_APP=src/server.py
```

- for windows
  - On CMD
  ```
  SET FLASK_APP="src/server.py"
  ```

  ```
  $env:FLASK_APP="src/server.py"
  ```

### **Create database tables from migrations**

To add the existing database schema and dummy data to your datebase, run:

```
flask db upgrade
```

Make your database changes accessible to others using migrations

```
flask db migrate
```

### **Run server application**

From the root folder, run

```
python src/server.py
```

The application will run at the specified port `APPLICATION_PORT` in `.env` file

The local URL to access the API should be `http://localhost:3303/`

You can visit the Products URL to test the application at `http://localhost:3303/products`

The API Swagger documentation should be accessible at `http://localhost:3303/apidocs`
